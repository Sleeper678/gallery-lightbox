                      Champ de Mars, 5 Av. Anatole France, 75007 Paris, Prancis

                      iffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ
                      de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer
                      Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower
                      from 1887 to 1889.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron
                      Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889
                      World's Fair. Although initially criticised by some of
                      France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design,
                      it has since become a global cultural icon of France and
                      one of the most recognisable structures in the world. The
                      tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022. The Eiffel
                      Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in
                      the world: 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was
                      designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named
                      part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the
                      Seine") in 1991.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same
                      height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure
                      in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410
                      ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel
                      Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the
                      tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held
                      for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City
                      was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the
                      world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in
                      height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at
                      the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the
                      Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding
                      transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest
                      free-standing structure in France after the Millau
                      Viaduct.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants
                      on the first and second levels. The top level's upper
                      platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest
                      observation deck accessible to the public in the European
                      Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or
                      lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground
                      level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the
                      climb from the first level to the second, making the
                      entire ascent a 600 step climb. Although there is a
                      staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only
                      by lift. On this top, third level is a private apartment
                      built for Gustave Eiffel's private use. He decorated it
                      with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such
                      as Thomas Edison.

                      rc de Triomphe de l'Étoile is one of the most famous
                      monuments in Paris, France, standing at the western end of
                      the Champs-Élysées at the centre of Place Charles de
                      Gaulle, formerly named Place de l'Étoile—the étoile or
                      "star" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating
                      avenues. The location of the arc and the plaza is shared
                      between three arrondissements, 16th (south and west), 17th
                      (north), and 8th (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those
                      who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary
                      and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French
                      victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer
                      surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown
                      Soldier from World War I.

                      <br />
                      The central cohesive element of the Axe historique
                      (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand
                      thoroughfares on a route running from the courtyard of the
                      Louvre to the Grande Arche de la Défense), the Arc de
                      Triomphe was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806; its
                      iconographic programme pits heroically nude French youths
                      against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail. It set
                      the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic
                      messages. Inspired by the Arch of Titus in Rome, Italy,
                      the Arc de Triomphe has an overall height of 50 m (164
                      ft), width of 45 m (148 ft) and depth of 22 m (72 ft),
                      while its large vault is 29.19 m (95.8 ft) high and 14.62
                      m (48.0 ft) wide. The smaller transverse vaults are 18.68
                      m (61.3 ft) high and 8.44 m (27.7 ft) wide.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Paris's Arc de Triomphe was the tallest triumphal arch
                      until the completion of the Monumento a la Revolución in
                      Mexico City in 1938, which is 67 m (220 ft) high. The Arch
                      of Triumph in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, is modeled on
                      the Arc de Triomphe and is slightly taller at 60 m (197
                      ft). The Grande Arche in La Défense near Paris is 110
                      metres high. Although it is not named an Arc de Triomphe,
                      it has been designed on the same model and from the
                      perspective of the Arc de Triomphe. It qualifies as the
                      world's tallest arch.

                      olosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of
                      the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It
                      is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is
                      still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world,
                      despite its age. Construction began under the emperor
                      Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD
                      under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further
                      modifications were made during the reign of Domitian The
                      three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as
                      the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the
                      Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and
                      archaeologists for its association with their family name
                      (Flavius)..

                      The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff
                      (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold
                      an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points
                      in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000;
                      it was used for gladiatorial contests and public
                      spectacles including animal hunts, executions,

                      ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval
                      era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing,
                      workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a
                      quarry, and a Christian shrine.

                      Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone
                      robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned
                      symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7
                      Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular
                      tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman
                      Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a
                      torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the
                      area around the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on
                      the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.

                      revi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is an
                      18th-century fountain in the Trevi district in Rome,
                      Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and
                      completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762[1] and several
                      others. Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 metres
                      (161.3 ft) wide,[2] it is the largest Baroque fountain in
                      the city and one of the most famous fountains in the
                      world.

                      The fountain, at the junction of three roads (tre vie),[3]
                      marks the terminal point[4] of the "modern" Acqua
                      Vergine—the revived Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that
                      supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with
                      the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source
                      of pure water some 13 km (8.1 mi) from the city. (This
                      scene is presented on the present fountain's façade.)
                      However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made
                      its length some 22 km (14 mi). This Aqua Virgo led the
                      water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more
                      than 400 years.[5]

                      <br />
                      The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic
                      style. When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest
                      and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in
                      the world.[5] The tower stands 316 feet (96 m) tall, and
                      the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps.
                      Its base is square, measuring 40 feet (12 m) on each side.
                      Dials of the clock are 22.5 feet (6.9 m) in diameter. All
                      four nations of the UK are represented on the tower on
                      shields featuring a rose for England, thistle for
                      Scotland, shamrock for Ireland, and leek for Wales.

                      <br />
                      Big Ben is the largest of the tower's five bells and
                      weighs 13.5 long tons (13.7 tonnes; 15.1 short tons).It
                      was the largest bell in the United Kingdom for 23 years.
                      The origin of the bell's nickname is open to question; it
                      may be named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw its
                      installation, or heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin
                      Caunt. Four quarter bells chime at 15, 30 and 45 minutes
                      past the hour and just before Big Ben tolls on the hour.
                      The clock uses its original Victorian mechanism, but an
                      electric motor can be used as a backup.

                      <br />
                      The tower is a British cultural icon recognised all over
                      the world. It is one of the most prominent symbols of the
                      United Kingdom and parliamentary democracy,and it is often
                      used in the establishing shot of films set in London.The
                      clock tower has been part of a Grade I listed building
                      since 1970 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.The
                      tower was repaired and renovated for four years between
                      2017 and 2021, during which the bells remained silent with
                      few exceptions.

                      tonehenge is a prehistoric monument on Salisbury Plain in
                      Wiltshire, England, two miles (3 km) west of Amesbury. It
                      consists of an outer ring of vertical sarsen standing
                      stones, each around 13 feet (4.0 m) high, seven feet (2.1
                      m) wide, and weighing around 25 tons, topped by connecting
                      horizontal lintel stones. Inside is a ring of smaller
                      bluestones. Inside these are free-standing trilithons, two
                      bulkier vertical sarsens joined by one lintel. The whole
                      monument, now ruinous, is aligned towards the sunrise on
                      the summer solstice. The stones are set within earthworks
                      in the middle of the densest complex of Neolithic and
                      Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred
                      tumuli (burial mounds).

                      <br />
                      Archaeologists believe that Stonehenge was constructed
                      from around 3000 BC to 2000 BC. The surrounding circular
                      earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase
                      of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC.
                      Radiocarbon dating suggests that the first bluestones were
                      raised between 2400 and 2200 BC,although they may have
                      been at the site as early as 3000 BC.

                      One of the most famous landmarks in the United Kingdom,
                      Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon.It has
                      been a legally protected scheduled monument since 1882,
                      when legislation to protect historic monuments was first
                      successfully introduced in Britain. The site and its
                      surroundings were added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage
                      Sites in 1986. Stonehenge is owned by the Crown and
                      managed by English Heritage; the surrounding land is owned
                      by the National Trust.

                      <br />
                      Stonehenge could have been a burial ground from its
                      earliest beginnings.Deposits containing human bone date
                      from as early as 3000 BC, when the ditch and bank were
                      first dug, and continued for at least another 500 years.

                      ower Bridge is a Grade I listed combined bascule and
                      suspension bridge in London, built between 1886 and 1894,
                      designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe
                      Barry with the help of Henry Marc Brunel.[1] It crosses
                      the River Thames close to the Tower of London and is one
                      of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge
                      House Estates, a charitable trust founded in 1282. The
                      bridge was constructed to give better access to the East
                      End of London, which had expanded its commercial potential
                      in the 19th century. The bridge was opened by Edward,
                      Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of
                      two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the upper
                      level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of
                      bascules that can open to allow shipping. Originally
                      hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was
                      converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The
                      bridge is part of the London Inner Ring Road and thus the
                      boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and remains
                      an important traffic route with 40,000 crossings every
                      day. The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles
                      and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers,
                      high-level walkways, and Victorian engine rooms form part
                      of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Tower Bridge has become a recognisable London landmark. It
                      is sometimes confused with London Bridge, about 0.5 miles
                      (800 m) upstream, which has led to a persistent urban
                      legend about an American purchasing the wrong bridge.

                      ena Palace is a Romanticist castle in São Pedro de
                      Penaferrim, in the municipality of Sintra, on the
                      Portuguese Riviera. The castle stands on the top of a hill
                      in the Sintra Mountains above the town of Sintra, and on a
                      clear day it can be easily seen from Lisbon and much of
                      its metropolitan area. It is a national monument and
                      constitutes one of the major expressions of 19th-century
                      Romanticism in the world. The palace is a UNESCO World
                      Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal. It
                      is also used for state occasions by the President of the

                    <h2>Park</h2>
                    <p>
                      Pena Park is a vast forested area completely surrounding
                      the Pena Palace, spreading for over 200 hectares of uneven
                      terrain. The park was created at the same time as the
                      palace by King Ferdinand II, who was assisted in the task
                      by the Baron von Eschwege and the Baron von Kessler. The
                      exotic taste of the Romanticism was applied to the park as
                      it was to the palace. The king ordered trees from diverse,
                      distant lands to be planted there. Those included North
                      American sequoia, Lawson's cypress, magnolia and Western
                      redcedar, Chinese ginkgo, Japanese Cryptomeria, and a wide
                      variety of ferns and tree ferns from Australia and New
                      Zealand, concentrated in the Queen's Fern Garden (Feteira
                      da Rainha). The park has a labyrinthic system of paths and
                      narrow roads, connecting the palace to the many points of
                      interest throughout the park, as well as to its two gated
                      exits.

                      elém Tower , officially the Tower of Saint Vincent
                      (Portuguese: Torre de São Vicente) is a 16th-century
                      fortification located in Lisbon that served as a point of
                      embarkation and disembarkation for Portuguese explorers
                      and as a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon.It was built during
                      the height of the Portuguese Renaissance, and is a
                      prominent example of the Portuguese Manueline style,but it
                      also incorporates hints of other architectural styles.The
                      structure was built from lioz limestone and is composed of
                      a bastion and a 30-metre (100 ft),four-storey tower.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Since 1983, the tower has been a UNESCO World Heritage
                      Site, along with the Jerónimos Monastery. It is often
                      portrayed as a symbol of Europe's Age of Discoveries and
                      as a metonym for Portugal or Lisbon, given its landmark
                      status. It has incorrectly been stated that the tower was
                      built in the middle of the Tagus and now sits near the
                      shore because the river was redirected after the 1755
                      Lisbon earthquake. In fact, the tower was built on a small
                      island in the Tagus river near the Lisbon shore.

                      asílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família,[a]
                      shortened as the Sagrada Família, is an under construction
                      church in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Catalonia,
                      Spain. It is the largest unfinished Catholic church in the
                      world. Designed by architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926), his
                      work on Sagrada Família is part of a UNESCO World Heritage
                      Site. On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated
                      the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      On 19 March 1882, construction of the Sagrada Família
                      began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In
                      1883, when Villar resigned, Gaudí took over as chief
                      architect, transforming the project with his architectural
                      and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear
                      Art Nouveau forms. Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life
                      to the project, and he is buried in the church's crypt. At
                      the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the
                      project was complete.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Relying solely on private donations, the Sagrada Família's
                      construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the
                      Spanish Civil War. In July 1936, anarchists from the FAI
                      set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the
                      workshop, partially destroying Gaudí's original plans.In
                      1939, Francesc de Paula Quintana took over site
                      management, which was able to go on due to the material
                      that was saved from Gaudí's workshop and that was
                      reconstructed from published plans and photographs.
                      Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the
                      1950s. Advancements in technologies such as computer-aided
                      design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have since
                      enabled faster progress and construction passed the
                      midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest
                      challenges remain, including the construction of ten more
                      spires, each symbolising an important Biblical figure in
                      the New Testament. It was anticipated that the building
                      would be completed by 2026, the centenary of Gaudí's
                      death,but this has now been delayed due to the COVID-19
                      pandemic.

                      <br />
                      Describing the Sagrada Família, art critic Rainer Zerbst
                      said "it is probably impossible to find a church building
                      anything like it in the entire history of art",[16] and
                      Paul Goldberger describes it as "the most extraordinary
                      personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the
                      Middle Ages".[17] The basilica is not the cathedral church
                      of the Archdiocese of Barcelona, as that title belongs to
                      the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia

                      euschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century historicist palace
                      on a rugged hill of the foothills of the Alps in the very
                      south of Germany, just north of Austria. It is located in
                      the Swabia region of Bavaria, in the municipality of
                      Schwangau, above the incorporated village of
                      Hohenschwangau, which is also the location of
                      Hohenschwangau Castle. The closest larger town is Füssen.
                      The castle stands above the narrow gorge of the Pöllat
                      [de] stream, east of the Alpsee and Schwansee lakes, close
                      to the mouth of the Lech into Forggensee.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Despite the main residence of the Bavarian monarchs at the
                      time—the Munich Residenz—being one of the most extensive
                      palace complexes in the world, King Ludwig II of Bavaria
                      felt the need to escape from the constraints he saw
                      himself exposed to in Munich, and commissioned
                      Neuschwanstein Palace on the remote northern edges of the
                      Alps as a retreat but also in honour of composer Richard
                      Wagner, whom he greatly admired.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Ludwig chose to pay for the palace out of his personal
                      fortune and by means of extensive borrowing rather than
                      Bavarian public funds. Construction began in 1869 but was
                      never completed. The castle was intended to serve as a
                      private residence for the king but he died in 1886, and it
                      was opened to the public shortly after his death. Since
                      then, more than 61 million people have visited
                      Neuschwanstein Castle. More than 1.3 million people visit
                      annually, with as many as 6,000 per day in the summer.

                      aint Peter's Basilica (Latin: Basilica Sancti Petri), is a
                      church built in the Renaissance style located in Vatican
                      City, the papal enclave that is within the city of Rome,
                      Italy. It was initially planned in the 15th century by
                      Pope Nicholas V and then Pope Julius II to replace the
                      aging Old St. Peter's Basilica, which was built in the
                      fourth century by Roman emperor Constantine the Great.
                      Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April
                      1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo,
                      Carlo Maderno and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the
                      most renowned work of Renaissance architecture and the
                      largest church in the world by interior measure. While it
                      is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor
                      the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome (these equivalent
                      titles being held by the Archbasilica of Saint John
                      Lateran in Rome), St. Peter's is regarded as one of the
                      holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as
                      "holding a unique position in the Christian world", and as
                      "the greatest of all churches of Christendom."
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial
                      site of Saint Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also
                      the first Bishop of Rome (Pope). Saint Peter's tomb is
                      supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica,
                      also known as the Altar of the Confession.For this reason,
                      many popes have been interred at St. Peter's since the
                      Early Christian period.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      St. Peter's is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its
                      liturgical functions. The pope presides at a number of
                      liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or
                      the adjoining St. Peter's Square; these liturgies draw
                      audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people. St.
                      Peter's has many historical associations, with the early
                      Christian Church, the Papacy, the Protestant Reformation
                      and Catholic Counter-Reformation and numerous artists,
                      especially Michelangelo. As a work of architecture, it is
                      regarded as the greatest building of its age.St. Peter's
                      is one of the four churches in the world that hold the
                      rank of Major papal basilica, all four of which are in
                      Rome, and is also one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of
                      Rome. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not a
                      cathedral because it is not the seat of a bishop; the
                      cathedra of the pope as bishop of Rome is at Saint John
                      Lateran.

                      cropolis of Athens (Ancient Greek: ἡ Ἀκρόπολις τῶν Ἀθηνῶν,
                      romanized: hē Akropolis tōn Athēnōn; Modern Greek:
                      Ακρόπολη Αθηνών, romanized: Akrópoli Athinón) is an
                      ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city
                      of Athens, Greece, and contains the remains of several
                      ancient buildings of great architectural and historical
                      significance, the most famous being the Parthenon. The
                      word Acropolis is from the Greek words ἄκρον (akron,
                      "highest point, extremity") and πόλις (polis, "city").The
                      term acropolis is generic and there are many other
                      acropoleis in Greece. During ancient times the Acropolis
                      of Athens was also more properly known as Cecropia, after
                      the legendary serpent-man Cecrops, the supposed first
                      Athenian king.

                      While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as
                      early as the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles
                      (c. 495–429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated
                      the construction of the buildings whose present remains
                      are the site's most important ones, including the
                      Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the Temple
                      of Athena Nike. The Parthenon and the other buildings were
                      seriously damaged during the 1687 siege by the Venetians
                      during the Morean War when gunpowder being stored by the
